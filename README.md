ðŸ“Œ Fine-Tuned GPT-2 for SMS Spam Detection
Built a binary text classifier by fine-tuning a lightweight transformer initialized with GPT-2 weights to detect spam in SMS messages.

Highlights:

Used the UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset for training

Applied GPT-2 tokenizer for consistent tokenization and trained the model using PyTorch

Preprocessed and balanced the dataset to improve model robustness

Developed a custom training loop with validation support

Achieved strong performance on detecting spam vs. ham
